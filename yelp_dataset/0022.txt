Great service and a super clean nice location here.
Considering this is in a busy airport, I was impressed.
The pricing here, which is about double to triple regular prices, was what knocks off a star for me.

If you're by the D gates at Sky Harbor, this is your coffee stop.
Much better than the Starsucks at the high C gates.

Spotted in due to flight delay.
The big comfy brown lawyer seats is what attracted me in.
I figured I could get some work done.
I ordered a non fat vanilla iced tea.
It was pretty good.
I noticed the prices were a lil bit more expensive.

$9 for a sandwich.
I guess you can charge whatever you want when the airport doesn't have any other options in concourse C

The line is quick, the people are friendly and the drinks are tasty.
Also for skyharbor employees, they actually give an airport discount, unlike Starbucks.

Try gingerbread latte yum.
This is the best looking, most comfortable airport coffee shop I've ever been in !!!
Big comfy chairs with little tables.
A big water container with cups in the restaurant away from the congestion of the order counter.
Friendly , happy workers equals happy customers.
I know you can't please everyone, but at 5am a room full of happy airline travelers is a hard thing to come by.
If your in need of coffee in Phoenix Sky Harbor , terminal 3 be sure to stop by and take a load off !
!

The lid fell off my cup, burned my hand, and spilled half of my coffee.
Employees never asked if I was okay, or offered to replace my coffee.
Will not be back to this location.

Delicious cup of coffee.
Very impressed Mr. Peets.
Will be returning whenever I can

The staff here is very friendly and accommodating.
They make sure to keep everything clean, which can sometimes be a challenge when you're working in an airport and have so many people coming through.
The coffee and sandwiches always wind up being delicious too!
