I dig this place.
Needed a quality 'za and got one here.
The pizza won't blow you away but it's customizable and tasty.
Nice that they have beer and wine available.
Tasty side salad too.
I'd come back!

Great pizza options (create your own, $11.86 no matter what toppings you choose) with beer & wine on tap.
Great addition to King East!
The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the bathrooms were pretty dirty and my chair at the table still had crumbs on it.

I dislike soggy pizzas.
This place doesn't serve soggy pizzas!
Great food, great service, and comfortable and relaxing environment.

Loved the atmosphere and the feel of the whole place.
I had the Aloha Smoke it was great.
Definitely will come back again.

Great value, reminds me of an Italian WIlbur in the east, would visit any time!
Building your own pizza just works!

Had a fantastic lunch here.
The pizza was cooked to perfection with fresh toppings.
Staff were friendly and efficient.
Will most definitely be back.

Amazing Salads!!!
Went here with my co-workers who wanted a quick pizza lunch and we tried a couple of the new meal sized salads.
They were so delicious and a nice option if you don't feel like a pizza like the rest of your group.

This place was one of those make your own pizza places.
The whole process from ordering, choosing toppings, and receiving the baked end result was quite a breeze.
I loved that they had eggs as one of their topping options.
Taste is quite good for my palette, though I kinda wished that the crust was a bit crispier and had more charcoal texture.
Overall, it's a good place to grab a quick bite of good pizza!

<SUMMARIES>
This place has some outstanding pizza!
For a reasonable price, you can make your own and put what ever toppings you want!
Its a really chill atmosphere with a decent drink menu.
I'll definitely be going back.
