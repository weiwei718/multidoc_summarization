What a find!
Can't think of anything to improve about this place.
The decor is festive, the service is friendly and very attentive, but best of all is the food.
The food is fantastic!
This is our third visit and the food continues to amaze.
The best Mexican Food we have had.
All this located in a small strip mall located on Carefree Highway just off of I-17.
I can't recommend this place enough.

Very colorful place.
Excellent service and the food is delicious.
All the dishes are well made and very tasty.
The prices are also very reasonable.
Definitely worth the visit.

The restaurant is cozy, clean and colorfully decorated.
The margaritas were good and the food is typical Americanized Mexican.
Great for families and kids as the bar area is tiny.

This is by far our favorite Mexican restaurant around us.
The service is top shelf, just like their delicious margs.
The food never disappoints.
Seriously every time I try something new, it becomes my favorite thing to get.
The staff treats you like family, and it is always a pleasant experience every time we go

Great food and wait staff was very happy and friendly good value happy hour deals pretty good as well

I love Plaza Bonita!!
I eat there nearly once a week.
I recommend Camerones Mexicanos and a Cadillac Margarita.

Possibly the most efficient service that I've ever had in a Mexican restaurant.
Really cute car and brightly painted chairs and tables.
Very bright Decore.
Food is right on

Good was very good, excellent fast service and the margaritas are great.
Had the chef salad, healthy option and my husband had the beef fajitas which were very good.

This place is warm and friendly.
Makes you feel like you're actually wanted there in the first place.
Quick, friendly service and food is also really good.
It's not the easiest place to find and looks pretty small, but once you're inside you're in for a treat.
