Excellent food and service.
The meet and cheese plate was delicious.
Server was attentive and enjoyable.

Good food, Great wine, Awesome ambiance, and Fantastic people!
We had a great time and LOVED the unique and very reasonably priced wine as well!
Had a great time and can't wait to get back!

Very busy and fun Friday night.
Music was great!!
They need more help for poor Matt behind the bar.
If he just had to pour wine and beer fine but he's mixing cocktails too and got very backed up!

The viognier was great but my salad tasted like someone poured 10 lbs of salt on it!
Go here if you like your food super salty.

A nice selection of his own wines and others.
Food was fantastic!
Had the stuffed mushrooms and pulled peek sliders.
Yummy!
And everyone was very friendly!
Great combination.

Loved the atmosphere!

I'm sure this could be a 4-star place for me, but I had a good time, not great.
A coworker and I came in after work to catch up after HH.
We shared the grilled artichoke and shrimp cocktail over a few glasses of wine.
The service was good and the food and wine was okay.
Might have been just average choices on our part which is why I wasn't wowed.
I'd definitely come in again though

My wife and I had dinner and wine here during their last week open.
The food and wine was fantastic as always.
It is unfortunate that Twisted Rose closed its doors.
They will be missed.

Read about the Sunday brunch on Chow Bella and decided to give it a try.
Was very impressed.
The food was delicious!
The french toast was out of this world, and the omelet was perfectly prepared.
We will definitely be back.

<SUMMARIES>
The food and atmosphere here are fantastic.
They have a very friendly and attentive staff that will always help you pair some of their great wines with your entree.
The next time you want some dinner, or just to get some drinks and appetizers this is a great place to check out!
