Came here with family out of town (Tustin, CA and Houston, TX) and we were impressed with the korean food here.
The Galbi and Bulgogi was delicious (tender and juicy) along with the a generous portion of the spicy squid.
Price is comparable and usual like other korean restaurants.
The only thing maybe have more of a variety of banchan (two of them were seaweed wrap).

If you are a asian, you must try this restaurant.
The tofu soup with seafood is so good!
And there will be a long line if you get there too late

Very good short ribs and tofu soup... Great korean food in Phoenix!
Will definitely be back for more!

My boyfriend picked up some random dishes on his way over one day.
Everything was delicious!
I didn't care for one of the sides, but seriously, I LOVED everything else.
I will definitely be going there again, maybe this time I will go in person.
I would highly recommend the spicy tofu soup, it was delectable.
I can't stop craving it!

Great place to get your Korean cravings satisfied in southern Arizona.
The place was busy and they carry your standard Korean dishes.
The side dishes were alright but better than none.

We come here often after having lived in Korea for over a year.
I love the yu kei chong and the bulgogi.
In wife gets dolsot and bipimbop.
The Kimchi is excellent.
They've got the Korean OB beer.
Highly recommend.

This is my benchmark for Bulgogi even after I moved back to Silicon Valley, where there are a ton of Korean restaurants.
They also serve excellent tofu soup and cold noodles.

Awesome service and attentive.
Authentic Korean, the best tofu soup.
This is my go-to place especially when I'm not well.
Nothing like a steaming bowl of spicy goodness to warm yourself up.
Sides are delicious too!
