just excellent.
friendly staff, good food, funky atmosphere.
there should be lines around the block to get in.
lobster bisque was excellent, the lobster shrimp tacos excellent.
seafood Ã©touffÃ©e excellent.
don't miss the desserts, just fabulous.

Food very good.
Small unassuming atmosphere with great seafood.
The clam chowder is very peppery so not for the weak at heart.

Over priced specials.
Not good.
The clam chowder was good.
Everything else mediocre at best.
Place smells too

The Falls' hidden gem -- kooky decor, decadent food at a reasonable price.
No reason why you shouldn't be eating here.

Fantastic place with phenomenal food.
Very unique.
Able to bring your own alcohol for a small fee.
Family atmosphere with exceptional service.
One of my new favorites for sure.

Very cool decor and atmosphere, but extremely limited menu and both times we were there, they were out of something we ordered.
Also, a little pricey for what you get.

This is my second time visiting---and the food has always been tasty.
They don't skip on the seafood.
We didn't come with a reservation, which kind of threw them off their game.
Food didn't come out very quickly this time, however, there was a large party so for the small kitchen it was understandable.
My fav item tonight was the salted carmel cheesecake.
The reason for the three star review is because they do not accept credit/debit cards...cash or check only.

Very good!
Many items made from scratch and fish is cleaned there.
The portions aren't too big.
Everything was flavored well.
Would def return.

The food is great here.
It can be a little expensive, but that doesn't take away from the good quality food.
Portion sizes are a average in size, but the taste is what you come here for, not for massive plates of food.
