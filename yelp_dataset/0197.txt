Food is very good, service and atmosphere really poor.
Best to get take out.
The rice and beef kabob was really off the charts.

Best kabob in town, I wish I could give more stars!
This is authentic afghan food, great choices and great food, I will definitely come back!

Perfect in every way!
The spices, the tenderness, the doneness.
My oh my!
The portions are super-generous, and the price is amazing.
Wow!
It also does not hurt that the people there are very nice and friendly.
Will definitely be added to my favorites.

Yum!
Hubs brought home "to go" order.
Super delish!
Lamb, beef and chicken seasoned and cooked perfectly.
Rice absolutely scrumptious.
Pita made from scratch.
Prices are more than reasonable.
Hubs said fam owned and awesome!
Will def order again!

I came accidentally to this place and guess whaaat???
-it was one of the best lunches in my life!
I've picked chicken kabob teka, the dish was delicious and the plate is pretty big.
In addition to great meal I've been enjoying the family business atmosphere- I appreciate a lot this part in restaurant business!
Generally, if you want to enjoy real authentic Persian dishes- Pro Kabob is the place number one in town.

Wow......This place is the bomb.
Have been here three times.
Now have an addiction to the chicken kabob, with brown rice.
Put this place on your must do list.
Peace out.

Food is ok and definitely not PERSIAN.
If you are craving Persian kabob go somewhere else.
It's not even close to Persian kabob.

Good food.
Nice people.
The beef tikka is definitely juicy and delicious.
Bolanee is also fresh and yummy.
The dough is prepared fresh, filled with potato or squash stuffing and seared.
Enjoy!

This place has a excellent price point, and the portions are generous.
The kabobs are wonderful but there are many delicious options.
The food is cooked and seasoned well.
Offers take out as well.
