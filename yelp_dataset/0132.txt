The food isn't the best, but pretty standard for a mexican restaurant.
The place is great for families, which I like.
They got us a table right away, and our waitress was great and fast despite the fact they seemed to have been completely understaffed the night we ate there.

We ordered the Pollo Rico.
It was great.
Our waitress, Bianca was good.
We will definitely return.

Went here for dinner while in town.
Extremely good Mexican food!
I had enchiladas.
YUMMY!
Chips and salsa was so tasty too!
To bad I don't drink!
The margaritas looked delicious as well.
Will be back when I visit Arizona again!

One of our favorite places...well used to be but now you can't park anywhere.
Have tried 3 times this week but between CB&CB, Oregano's and a few other places...there is no parking.
Guess we'll keep going to El Palacios.

Nandos is one of my favorite restaurants ever!
I always get the same dish every time.
Enchiladas!!
That is my go to food always!
No complaints ;)

The food is always hot, fresh & yummy.
Big portions.
We LOVE the chips and salsa.
Atmosphere is great and staff is friendly.

Nandos is a nice place to go for a meal.
The service was excellent.
The portions were large.
The fajitas my wife had were excellent.
The Mexican pizza was very good.
The chips and salsa were great.
My meal was good not great.
The rice was very average.
The cheese on my meal was more of a Colby jack as opposed to a nice white Mexican cheese.
The atmosphere was very pleasant and the place was hopping on a Friday night.
I would go back.

The atmosphere is warm and inviting but the food here is lackluster.
Bland salsa and tasteless chips to start.
We had the special: tilapia fish tacos.
Mushy fish and greasy corn tortillas.
The rice and beans were the best part of our meal.
This is our third time to try this place.
Not going back.

Pretty standard Mexican joint.
Good service but parking can be difficult.
Chips and Salsa were both great.
Warm atmosphere as well.
