I eat here once a year or two.
It is always good.
Sometimes the wait can be a bit long because it is very popular.
This is a great place for groups and because of this, it can be pretty noisy.
Love their thin chips and good, spicy salsas.
I ordered the street tacos and they were delicious.
All of my dining partners were quite satisfied with their meals.
Pretty decent prices, too.

Great authentic Mexican food at a reasonable price.
Free chips and salsa too.
Oh and they have delicious margaritas.
Very friendly.

We love this place!
Our "date night" always consist of Margaritas & this is the spot!!

This was my family's first time visiting and we had an amazing experience!
We were warmly greeted and immediately seated by the hostess.
Then our AMAZING server Mauricio came and took our order.
He was very polite and knowledgeable; he's been working there for 17 years!!!
Then Julie, our food expeditor, brought our food and was amazing with my 3-year old... Told him his food was made special for him.
I loved the atmosphere and the food was beyond amazing; its very true to the culture and authentic.
We have found our new home!รยก

The average for this place seems about four stars.
I concur.
The service is pretty good but not extraordinary.
The food is satisfying but not great.
The price is fair.
My gripe is that the food seemed burnt all around.
Overall worth going but don't expect anything special.

Patio seating is great.
Waiters are awesome.
Food is middle of the road.
It's a good place to go with it being close to my family's home.
Fiesta platter is huge and great for two to share.
Specials are a good value and plenty of food if you aren't picky.
It's the go-to place for sit down mexican when we are in town.

The best bar service in the area
 Jose.
Rocky.
Drew.
You rock.
Consistently great.
Good management.

One of the best Mexican restaurants I've been to.
Service is consistently good, food is consistently good.
I often order the 3 Amigos.
The carne asada is excellent.
Can't go wrong with this place.
Been here at least 30 times.

The servers are kind and knowledgeable, they will patiently answer your questions.
They offer patio seating if you'd prefer to sit outside.
The free chips and salsa are always a plus, and the margaritas are amazing too.
The menu is full tasty authentic Mexican dishes.
