Just got my lashes done today by Devon and I absolutely love what she did to them.
I will definitely be retuning!!
!

Amazing place!!
They have awesome quality and amazing service!!
If you are wanting to get your lashes down come to this location!
!

Very relaxing environment, they really care about maintaining the health of your lashes as well as achieving the look you're going for.
Olivia is very sweet and let's me sleep during my appointment so she can focus lol!
They always turn out great!

I love the Lash & Sugar company!
The everyone at the salon are wonderful, professional and best all the services they provide is top notch!
Thank you ladies!

I had a great experience with my first fill with Alesha.
She fit me in for a 30 minute fill to hold me over until I could get a longer appointment.
My lashes look great and have stayed on much better than lashes I've gotten at other salons.
I look forward to my next appointment!

I am so happy with my new eyelashes!
Alesha did an amazing job.
She is a perfectionist!
I have been there two times now - the second time for the fills and both times was a great experience.
I won't go anywhere else!

Been going back for last 3 months !
Still very satisfied with my lashes and feeling gorgeous everyday ;) Megan & Alesha both are amazing !!
Would love to try all the other girls in the near future !
And they are very honesty with their time and will never charge you extra!!
Always a happy girl when I'm there!

At first I was a little nervous because I've had a bad experience with eyelash extensions in the past, but after I saw my lashes (level 2 classic full set) I was instantly in love.
My lashes are super comfortable I sometimes forget I have them.
I will definitely be coming back!

My eyelashes have never looked better and its all thanks to this wonderful place!
Everyone here is so professional, especially Devon!
I plan on coming back whenever I need my lashes done.
